# NOTE

[ ] receptive of LGN cell 

[ ] Orientation

```
Orientation selectivity can be built up from spatial interactions between different centre surround cells. This group of three all need to
be active for this filter to respond, and the neighbours must be inactive
```

-- [ ] stimulus{刺激}

[ ] Orientation detection



[ ] V1

```
Responses to specific edge orientations first
emerge in the primary visual cortex, or V1, the
first area processing vision in the brain.
These cells respond when an edge has a specific
orientation (the preferred orientation) and is
shown in a specific position.
```

[ ] V1 feature maps

-- [ ] Colour (red, green, blue yellow, light, dark)
-- [ ] Eye (left, right)
-- [ ] Spatial frequency (continuous)
-- [ ] Orientation (continuous)
-- [ ] Motion direction (continuous)

[ ] V2/V3

```

```



[ ] IT/MT

```
After V3, form and motion information are often
processed separately in different areas.
```

[ ] Face perception

```
Here we see human face-selective
cortex with fMRI
```

-- [ ] distributed encoding

```
Allows some cell death without representation failing(graceful degradation), most of pattern remains.
Allows new patterns to be stored without new cells, new objects can be stored, a fixed group of cells can store a variable number of objects.
Consistent with measured cell properties
Most of the pattern remains rarely all-or-nothing responses
Disadvantage: Harder for humans
to understand

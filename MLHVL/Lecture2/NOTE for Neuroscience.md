### Neuron

[ ] neuron

```
A neuron is a specialised type of animal cell
Biological neuron has 4 parts, cell body, 
```

-- [ ] membrane/cell membrane{细胞膜}

-- [ ] cell body

```
also called soma
```

-- [ ] Dendrites{树突}

```
Dendrites integrating electrical signals coming in from other neurons that it is connected to.
```

-- [ ] Axon{}

-- [ ] Axon Terminal

```
Transmite the information
```

[ ] synaptic

[ ] Nerve

-- [ ] ion channel

```
Ion channels are imbedded in a cell membrane.
charged atoms, or ions, of sodium and potassium (natrium and kalium) to pass into and out of a neuron through Ion channels.
far more sodium is outside, few more potassium ion is inside. And imbalance of electrically-charged ions causes a voltage dierence.
It is passive.
So opening sodium ion channels causes sodium ions to enter the cell through the cell membrane, changing the membrane voltage or membrane potential.
```

-- [ ] membrane voltage/membrane potential{膜电压/膜电位}

-- [ ] neuron fire/activation

```
The process of normal neuronal firing takes place as a communication between neurons through electrical impulses and neurotransmitters
the amount of activation is what is simulated by the activation values in the feature maps on CNN
```



-- [ ] chemical gradient/electrical gradient

```

```

[ ] voltage{电压}

[ ] Action potential/graded potential

```
excitatory post-synaptic potential(EPSP)
inhibitory post-synaptic potential(IPSP)
```

[ ] depolarization{去极化}

```
a spike of voltage or action potential.
will be passed down the axon to the next layer of neurons
```

[ ] repolarization

```
repolarization is the process or act of restoring the polarized condition across the membrane of a cell
```



[ ] ION/ion 

-- [ ] ion channel 



[ ] Weights in neurons

```
unsupervised processes
Cells that fire togethe, wire together
```

### photoreceptors

[ ] photoreceptors

```
the eye has four types of sensor
three are color-sensitive cones sensor and one is rod sensor.
Rods don’t carry colour information, but
respond quickly and under low light
conditions. Their output also gives good
information about fast events like moving
objects.
Together they output four feature maps.
```

[ ] Cones/Rods

```
four sensor of light
```

[ ] inversion

```
The brain’s representation of visual space
is also ipped up-down and left-right
```

### Cortical map representations

[ ] Cortical map representations

```
spatially map the structure of sensory organ onto cortex
```

[ ] surround supperession

```
Surround suppression is where the relative firing rate of a neuron may under certain conditions decrease when a particular stimulus is enlarged.
```

-- [ ] complementary filter

-- [ ] normalization

-- [ ]

[ ] receptive field

```
The part of the input IMAGE that produces a positive response in a biological neuron is the ‘receptive field’
```



[ ] colour opponency



[ ] Receptive eld extent and spatial frequency

```
Using these differently sized receptive fields,
effectively different filter sizes, the retina can break down any image into different components at
different spatial frequencies, different spatial
scales
```



-- [ ] ganglion cells

[ ] Normailization

```
Inhibition of activity by average nearby activity
```

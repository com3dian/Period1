# NOTE

[ ] benefits & disadvantages of using models 

```
Working code as formal specification of a theory
Working code is detailed
Models can make predictions
Understanding by building
```

[ ] usages of models for industry/practice

```
Applied systems informed by theory
Intelligent game opponents
Usability Test
Adaptive interface
Software & interface design
```

[ ] benefits of models for industry/practice

```
Have human-like experiences.
Make appropriate, (adaptive) decisions due to understanding of user.
Intelligent conversational agent.
Keep track of user's...Intentions/Needs/Attention.
Use to make (pro-active) intelligent decisions.
Implementation beyond scope for MAIR.

[ ] difference between cognitive model and cognitive architecture

```
Within the architecture you develop models of 
specific tasks/setting.
Cognitive architecture is more general, it is one theory that can describe all facets of human behavier.
unified theroy of cognition.
```

[ ] cognitive model(if it is in cognitive architecture)

```
Identify which functions are achieved by the 
brain/cognition on each time step.
Specify each process using principle of cognitive architecture
1 task = 1 cognitive model
```



[ ] cognitive models and architectures  with strong/weak AI, Turing machine, over & under constrained theory

```

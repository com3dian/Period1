    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "PyTorch (or just torch) is a python deep learning library, by now getting widely adopted both in research and industry. Like most deep learning libraries it employs GPU accelaration; unlike most deep learning libraries, it supports dynamic computational graphs and deep python integration, enabling easy experimentation and code inspection. It provides high-level abstractions but also allows for low-level access to its primitives. You can read more about PyTorch at the official [site](https://pytorch.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing PyTorch on your machine\n",
    "Install PyTorch by following the guidelines here [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> If you have an nVidia GPU, installing a CUDA version of PyTorch will allow you to utilize it, significantly speeding up computation.\n",

    "# This Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will take you through PyTorch's main functionalities. It only aims to give you some insight on how to use PyTorch and is by no means a full tutorial on neural networks. Prior knowledge of neural netowrks and their inner workings (i.e. linear algebra, gradient-based optimization, back-propagation, etc.) will certainly prove useful. You are assumed to be largely fluent in python.\n",

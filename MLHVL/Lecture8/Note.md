[ ] Representation & Organization conceptual knowledge

-- [ ] Computational 

[ ] Approach

```
A model to predict the neural actication of any given stimulus words using 2 step process
```

-- [ ] Encoding

```
encode the stimulus word as semantic feature computed from the occurences of the stimulus word within a large text corpus.
```

-- [ ] stimulus{刺激，外部刺激}

-- [ ] Prediction

```
n is the length of semantic feature, while the f_i is the ith semantic feature.
c_vi is the learned scalar parameter.
For each voxel, y_v is computed.
```

$$
y_{v} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{vi} f(w)
$$



[ ] sensorimotor cortical area

```
area of the brain that comprises the precentral and postcentral gyri and thus covers the primary sensory and motor areas of the brain
```

-- [ ] brain image 

```
brain image is to represent the FMRI activity
```



[ ] Assumption

-- [ ] computational linguistic

```
the semantic features distinguish the meaning of arbitrary concrete nouns 
```

-- [ ] brain activity

```
brain activity when thinking about concrete noun can be derived as a weighted linear sum of contributions from each of its semantic features
```
